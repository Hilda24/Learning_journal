Things that I learnt:
#In order to be more productive we have to focus.
#But often we fail to stay focused our conscious part of our brain maybe in frenzy mode.
#One of the best way to focused is by practicing meditation as it helps us to create a space between our emotions and self.
#Being productive is not merely being busy or doing any work. It means doing works that are important to us.

    2.Take time to analyse and organize the plans that you have for the day.
