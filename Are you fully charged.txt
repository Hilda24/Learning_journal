Things that I learnt:
#The ways to get fully charged in life ultimately boils down to three main keys
#Key1- Do meaningful things
  Do things that really mean something to us can really create an impact in our lives. The things that we do need not be necessarily big, they can be pretty small things like helping mom do the dishes etc.
#Key2-Positive Interactions
  Make sure that we have many positive interactions in our day-to-day life. Those interactions can be between you and your family or between you and a stranger. Take a walk not by yourself but with your loved ones as it is bound to spark some positive interactions.
#Key3-Have Energy
   Getting a good night's sleep will act as a reset button and bring you back to your baseline even if you have had a pretty rough day. It is important for us to sometimes place our needs in front of others needs.
#Favorite sentence: "Don't go in pursuit of happiness rather go in pursuit of meaning in life".
#When we live a meaning full life, happiness comes along naturally.
