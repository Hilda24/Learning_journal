Things that I learnt:
#Good things come to those who wait. But better things come to those who go out and get them.
#The heart know what we really want to become. So before you start the day, ask in this question to yourself "If today was my last day, will I do the things that I am about to do?"
#Believe in ourself before anyone else does.
#Limitations exists only in our minds. If we start using our imagination then the possibilities become limitless.
#If you are passionate and driven, your light shine.
#Be able to scarifice what you are for what you wanna become.
